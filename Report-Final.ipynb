The algorithm that i will be using will be the decision tree model.\n\nThe aim of the study is to see if the machine learning model can predict the severity level based on the number of person, cyclist, and vehicles that are involved in teh accident and if the drivers are speeding. The people might be interested in this project will be the doctors and nurses from emergency room, since emergency room doctors are always busy and its hard for them to determine how many people they need for the accident so if this machine learning model can have high accuracy to predict the severity level of the patients, it will be easier for the emergency room doctors and nurses to have enough resources for the patients before the ambulacne arrived to hospitals from accidents sites."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data\n<br>\nThis dataset continas of 194673 x 38 entries, there are 37 attributes with data types of text, int and float. \n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Methodology\n<br>\n1. Select the dependent and independent variables for the machine learning model. In this case, the dependent variable (predict) is the severity level. The independent variable (X) are the person count, pedestrian count, vehicle count, parked car hit count, speeding or not, and attention or not. \n<br>\n<br>\n2. Replace the NAN value in the speeding and attention column. Replace NAN with No.\n<br><br>\n3. Covert the column with Yes and No as data to numeric variable. Yes as 1 and No as 0\n<br><br>\n4. Split the data into train dataset and test data set as the ratio of 8:2\n<br><br>\n5. Use decision tree classifer model to predict the accident severity\n<br><br>\n6.

Results show that the f1 score for the train data is 0.849 and decreased to 0.847 for the test data. As the result, the model performed well to predict the severity of the accidents with high accuracy. In this case, the personnel at the hospitals emergency room can have a high accuracy of prediction on deciding how many personnel they need to help out the patients before the ambublance arrive to the hospital from the accidents site"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Conclusion\n<br>\nThe aim of this project is to use machine learning to solve real world problems. In this case, decision tree algroithm was used to predict the accident severity level.
